## Getting Started
This is idempotent python3 script. It is possible to execute this script in completely new and clean environment any number of times.

### Prerequisites
You must have it:
* [python3](https://www.python.org/) - is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
* [python3-pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - is a package management system

### Commands
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MatusevychYevhenii/OpsWorks.git  # Clone repository with script
$ cd OpsWorks  # Go to local repository
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # Install requirements for running script
$ ./opswork.py -h  # Show help and more options
$ ./opswork.py -i  # Run script (install environment)
$ ./opswork.py -c  # Clear environment
```
Then go to your browser and open url that you have received from script (running instance dns name) with credentials.
